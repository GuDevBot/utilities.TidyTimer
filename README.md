## üßπ About the Project

Have you ever asked yourself, "When was the last time I cleaned the air conditioner?" or "Is it time to wash the curtains again?". **TidyTimer** was born to solve exactly this problem.

This app allows you to register household chores, set how often they need to be done, and from there, it manages a countdown timer for each one. With a clean and focused interface, you'll always know which task needs your attention next.

This project was built as a practical exercise, exploring modern Flutter development concepts, from state management with Cubit to data persistence with a local database.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Add Tasks:** Create new tasks with a name, category, and repetition frequency.
* **Automatic Countdown:** Each task displays a "live" timer (e.g., `12d 8h 3min`) for the next due date.
* **Visual Feedback:** Tasks change color to indicate urgency (orange) or overdue status (red).
* **Mark as Done:** When you complete a task, the timer is automatically reset based on the defined frequency.
* **Swipe to Delete:** Manage your list quickly and intuitively.
* **Undo Delete:** Deleted a task by mistake? One click and it's back!
* **Local Persistence:** Your tasks are saved on your device. They'll be there when you close and reopen the app.
* **Dark Theme Support:** The interface is adapted for light and dark modes.

## üí° Future Improvements

This project has a lot of potential to grow! Some ideas for the future:

* [ ] **Push Notifications** to warn about due tasks.
* [ ] **Categories and Filters** to better organize tasks.
* [ ] **Statistics Screen** to gamify cleaning.
* [ ] **Editing** existing tasks.
* [ ] **Cloud Sync** (Firebase/Supabase) for backup and multi-device use.
